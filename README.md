# SmolChat - On-Device Inference of SLMs in Android

## Project Goals

- Provide a usable user interface to interact with local SLMs (small language models) locally, on-device
- Allow users to add/remove SLMs (GGUF models) and modify their system prompts or inference parameters (temperature, 
  min-p)

## Technologies

* [ggerganov/llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp) is a pure C/C++ framework to execute machine learning 
  models on multiple execution backends. It provides a primitive C-style API to interact with LLMs 
  converted to the [GGUF format](https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml/blob/master/docs/gguf.md) native to [ggml]
  (https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml)/llama.cpp. The app uses JNI bindings to interact with a small class `smollm.
  cpp` which uses llama.cpp to load and execute GGUF models.

* [ObjectBox](https://objectbox.io) is a on-device, high-performance NoSQL database with bindings available in multiple 
  languages. The app 
  uses ObjectBox to store the model, chat and message metadata.

* [noties/Markwon](https://github.com/noties/Markwon) is a markdown rendering library for Android. The app uses 
  Markwon and [Prism4j](https://github.com/noties/Prism4j) (for code syntax highlighting) to render Markdown responses 
  from the SLMs.
